                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>With my passion for computers, specifically hardware, I would love to help others and 
                share what I know, and be remembered for making a difference in peoples lives. I want 
                others to feel confident in technology just as much as I do, making people remember me 
                for something good. </p>
